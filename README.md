# TCSMS
Code used in "[Temporal correlations in the simplest measurement sequences](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2022-01-18-623/)"

* `DCPatterns.py`: Sample Python code for the DCPatterns algorithm.

* `Opt_Q_clock.py`: Optimization of the quantum one-way model, used for the investigation of the quantum bound. Results (in binary float32 format) contained in `new_prob_2_500.dat`.

* `optimize.py`: Survey of classical models of general sequences in various dimensions.

* `classicalprob.mx`: The optimal probabilities found for the numerical survey of classical models, with the optimal EMCMs probabilities for the one-tick sequences.

* `qopt.py`: Survey of quantum models, including multiple Kraus operators.

* `analysis_classical.nb`: Analysis and investigations of the classical models.

* `surveydata.zip`: Contains the folder of cached results of previous numerical surveys of classical models. We compressed it here to keep the repository simpler and smaller.

* `quantumsurveydata.zip`: Contains the Kraus operators found in the numerical survey
