Code used in "[Temporal correlations in the simplest measurement sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.02467)"

* `DCPatterns.py`: Sample Python code for the DCPatterns algorithm.

* `Opt_Q_clock.py`: Optimization of the quantum one-way model, used for the investigation of the quantum bound. Results (in binary float32 format) contained in `new_prob_2_500.dat`.

* `optimize.py`: Survey of classical models of general sequences in various dimensions.

* `analysis_classical.nb`: Analysis and investigations of the classical models.

* `analysis_quantum.nb`: Analysis and investigations of the quantum models.

* `survey_quantum.nb`: Optimization of quantum models.


* `surveydata.zip`: Contains the folder of cached results of previous numerical surveys. We compressed it here to keep the repository simpler and smaller.
